Before appliing, please read the wiki article about this topic: [How to apply for the default package list for one of your packages](https://github.com/PentagonLP/ccpt/wiki/How-to-apply-for-the-default-package-list-for-one-of-your-packages)

**Name**
Name of your package

**Description**
What does your package do what is it for? Which features does it have? Please provide a detailed description, not just one sentence :)

**Link to "packageinfo.ccpt"-file**
If you are now asking yourself: "What is a 'packageinfo.ccpt'-file?", then you should still wait a bit with appliing :) [Click here to get started](https://github.com/PentagonLP/ccpt/wiki/Create-your-own-package)

**Suggested package ID**
You may suggest an ID for your package under which your package will be able to be installed, please make sure that it isn't already taken (eg by issuing the command 'ccpt info <Your ID>'). We can't gurantee though if this ID will be the final one.
